/**
 * 
 * This is a subsystem for dealing with the filesystem.
 * Initially, it will contain only those methods which are used by publishing, 
 * but, this may be expanded in the future.
 * 
 * It is important to note that this class requires all 
 * remote paths in the signatures to already be absolute
 * for the system to which the resource is to be copied. 
 * 
 * This behavior is different than {@link IPublishCopyCallbackHandler},
 * which takes paths relative to whatever path the object was instantiated with. 
 * 
 * Methods in this class should return an error status or warning status
 * for any important information that should be logged. It should only
 * throw a {@link CoreException} in cases where the publish should be
 * immediately terminated. 
 * 
 * @since 3.0
